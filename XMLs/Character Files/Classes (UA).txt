				<text>Beginning	at	1st	level,	you	have	significant	experience	studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.</text>
				<text>    Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</text>
				<text>    When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free yo pick any language you wish to learn.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Natural Explorer</name>
				<text>You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• You ignore difficult terrain.</text>
				<text>• You have advantage on initiative rolls.</text>
				<text>• On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.</text>
				<text />
				<text>    In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</text>
				<text>• You group can't become lost except by magical meants</text>
				<text>• Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</text>
				<text>• If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>• When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</text>
				<text>• While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature>
				<name>Fighting Style</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialy. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</text>
			</feature>

				<name>Two-Weapon Fighting</name>
				<text>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</text>
			</feature>
			
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text />
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature>
				<name>Primeval Awareness</name>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.</text>
				<text>    You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.</text>
				<text>    You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes</text>
				<text>    Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures' general direction and distance (in miles) from you.</text>
				<text>    If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Ranger Conclave</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave: the Beast Conclave, the Hunter Conclave, or the Stalker Conclave, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional ="YES">
				<name>Beast Conclave</name>
				<text>Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Beast Conclave develop a close bond with a beast, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional ="YES">
				<name>Beast Conclave: Animal Companion</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.</text>
				<text>With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.</text>
				<text>At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.</text>
				<text>If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.</text>
				<text>If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional ="YES">
				<name>Beast Conclave: Companion's Bond</name>
				<text>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</text>
				<text>    The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</text>
				<text>    The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</text>
				<text>    When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Keeping Track of Proficiency</text>
				<text>When you gain your animal companion at 3rd level, its proficiency bonus matches yours at +2. As you gain levels and increase your proficiency bonus, remember that your companion's proficiency bonus improves as well, and is applied to the following areas: Armor Class, skills, saving throws, attack bonus, and damage rolls.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</text>
				<text>    Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</text>
				<text>    For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</text>
				<text>    Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</text>
				<text>    Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</text>
				<text>    Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."</text>
				<text />
				<text>    d6  Trait</text>
				<text>     1  I'm dauntless in the face of adversity.</text>
				<text>     2  Threaten my friends, threaten me.</text>
				<text>     3  I stay on alert so others can rest.</text>
				<text>     4  People see an animal and underestimate me. I use that to my advantage</text>
				<text>     5  I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time.</text>
				<text>     6  I put my friends' needs before my own in all things.</text>
				<text />
				<text>    d6  Flaw</text>
				<text>     1  If there's food left unattended, I'll eat it.</text>
				<text>     2  I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me.</text>
				<text>     3  Any time is a good time for a belly rub.</text>
				<text>     4  I'm deathly afraid of water.</text>
				<text>     5  My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face.</text>
				<text>     6  I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional ="YES">
				<name>Hunter Conclave: Hunter's Prey</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.</text>
				<text>    Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</text>
				<text>    Giant Killer. When a Large or lerger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.</text>

				<text>    Evasion. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</text>

				<name>Deep Stalker Conclave</name>
				<text>Most folk descend into the depths of the Underdark only under the most pressing conditions, undertaking some desperate quest or following the promise of vast riches. All too often, evil festers beneath the earth unnoticed, and rangers of the Deep Stalker Conclave strive to uncover and defeat such threats before they can reach the surface.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional ="YES">
				<name>Deep Stalker Conclave: Underdark Scout</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. On your first turn during combat, you gain a +10 bonus to your speed, and if you use the Attack action, you make one additional attack.</text>
				<text>    You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. Such creatures gain no benefit when attempting to detect you in dark and dim conditions. Additionally, when the DM determines if you can hide from a creature, that creature gains no benefit from its darkvision.</text>
